"""
Debug/diagnostic commands for the GameBoyRL pipeline. Registered on the click group in
debug.py, mirroring vlm.py / vlm_scripts.

Every command is read-only over artifacts the pipeline is guaranteed to have written, and
raises (naming the producing script) when a required artifact is absent. Nothing here
reads logs/, wandb or slurm.

Two commands need more than saved artifacts: `zeroshot` opens an emulator for each
init_state's first frame, and `compare` opens one and *does* take steps, replaying each
episode's recorded action sequence to reconstruct frames. Neither constructs a VLM.
