"""
Entry point for the benchmark_scripts package. Use --help for CLI options.

Five arms, one group, each adding one capability to the one before it::

    run_benchmark.py --game X baseline                  no supervisor reasoning at all
    run_benchmark.py --game X revision                  short legs, hint revised between them
    run_benchmark.py --game X subgoal                   a plan from the task alone
    run_benchmark.py --game X info_subgoal_parametric   planned from the model's own priors
    run_benchmark.py --game X info_subgoal_retrieval    planned from a distilled document

The subcommand word IS the supervisor's registry key (execution.registry.AVAILABLE_SUPERVISORS)
and the CSV stem, with the one exception that the control arm's key is ``dummy``.

Called by scripts/benchmark/run_benchmark.sh.

Options shared by every arm live on the group and reach the subcommands through ctx.obj;
each arm declares only what is its own. Group options must precede the subcommand word.

Every arm's CSV carries a trailing session_dirs column and no n_resets column, so CSVs
written before this package cannot be resumed — ``load_checkpoint`` refuses them. The fix is
--regenerate, or moving the old file aside.
