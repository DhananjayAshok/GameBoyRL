3. Interact(target): interact with the object or entity directly in front of the player, e.g. to talk to someone or read a sign. Name the target, e.g. Interact(wooden signpost).
4. Battle(optional instructions): fight the battle that is on screen, optionally with instructions, e.g. Battle() or Battle(use Thundershock and do not switch Pokemon).
5. Menu(specific instruction): use the menu system to do something specific, e.g. Menu(use a Potion on Pikachu). Only works in the main menu opened with Start, or in a menu that is already open.
6. Dialogue(): press through the dialogue that is on screen until it ends.
7. Free(instruction; stop when: condition): press single buttons (a, b, start, arrows) towards something specific, and say what to stop at. The condition must be something visible on screen, e.g. Free(walk up and down inside the patch of tall grass; stop when: a wild Pokemon appears). Use this when none of the others fit."""
