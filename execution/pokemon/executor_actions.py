    Is Valid When:
    - In Free Roam State
    - ``target`` is a non-empty string

    Action Success Interpretation:
    - -1: The target is not in any of the eight cells around the agent.
    - 0: The target is in a cardinal cell, so the agent can face it. ``direction`` says which way.
    - 1: The target is only in a diagonal cell, which cannot be faced or interacted with.

    Action Returns:
    - `cell` (`Optional[Tuple[int, int]]`): The cell holding the target, or None.
    - `direction` (`str`): Present for code 0 — the direction to face.
    - `found_cells` / `found_cells_str`: The same cell, kept for callers that render it.
